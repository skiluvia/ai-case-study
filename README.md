## Overview and Origin

Construction is a tough work that is only getting tougher. With skilled workers retiring at a record rate, there is lack the workers needed for manual labor. This workforce gap leaves the construction industry in a constant state of catch-up. **Canvas Construction** focuses on drywall finishing process by reducing the number of days and manual labor that is required to achive the goal with a superb quality. Canvas Drywall finishing robot in the hands of trade skilled workers will revolutionize how buildings are built.

## Business Activities & Landscape

**Canvas** is faily new company and it started in 2017. It is primarily focused on construction industry. **Kevin Albert** is the co-founder and COE of the company. He focused on machines in his past. Kevin from a robotic field and he was always facinated by how robotics provided us with capabilities we did not have. Robotics brings in mechanical and software enginering together. *He learned how to design algorythms where a robotic walking dog can navigate through a terrain*. He compared this with construction environment where there are a lot uncertainties around you. Machines paired with Human takes the power from both sides. 

There were a few criteria the company looked at to come up with the design solution or what issue they were trying to address. 

* Dirty: This is always a messy work
* Danger: Most drywall finisher end up at their retirement with orthopedic issues on the shoulders and arms, or even falling during work
* Lack of innovation: How long there hasn't been any innovation on a particular problem
* Repetition: It has been the same drywall, it is everywhere, and being finished the same way for at least 50 years.
* *How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?*


## How it works
Canvas system uses computer vision and artificial intelligence to be able to recognize different seams and wall types, and identify where those seems are; so that machine can profile a custome profile material. It takes conceptually less material and safer for tapers. The actual machine or device is built like a small or large scissor lift which can also reach higher walls as high as 40ft.

Drywall finish is a multi-steps process after hanging drywall panels and just before painting. This includes filling the seams between the uneven panels. If it is a person doing manual work, the steps involved are applying the tape and mud, then let it dry. Second step is to repeat mudding, sanding and letting it dry again. These steps repeat at least 3 times in order to achieve a smooth whole uniform surface of drywall. This usually is a 5 to 7 days process depending on high quality outcome you desire.

The canvas robotic machine is brought in after manual taping is done on day 1. Machine measures geographic landscape of the walls or room and does the calibration. Sensors on the machine measures the depth of the different areas of the wall. It also maps out outlets or spaces. This allows the application of materials be applied accurately. This machine applies all needed compound on day one and let it dry. Sanding is done on day two and this can be done either by the machine itself using a detachable mechanism or separate tools which are always used for sanding.

Changing the code and user interface as a user keep using the machine.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Landscape

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?

* What are the other major companies in this field?

## Results

Getting beutifully finished drywall on schedule and with budget got much easier. Entire process is done in 2 days instead of 5 or 7 days. Comparing this to days where workers dug holes using a shovel until the excavator invention. Now instead of using trowels, buckets and pans, we are using machine. This increases productivity and safety.


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
