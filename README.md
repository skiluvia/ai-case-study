## Overview and Origin

Construction is a tough work that is only getting tougher. With skilled workers retiring at a record rate, there is lack the workers needed for manual labor. This workforce gap leaves the construction industry in a constant state of catch-up. **Canvas Construction** focuses on drywall finishing process by reducing the number of days and manual labor that is required to achive the goal with a superb quality. Canvas Drywall finishing robot in the hands of skilled workers will revolutionize how buildings are built.

**Canvas** is faily new company and it started in 2017. It is primarily focused on construction industry. **Kevin Albert** is the co-founder and COE of the company. He focused on machines in his past. Kevin from a robotic field and he was always facinated by how robotics provided us with capabilities we did not have. Robotics brings in mechanical and software enginering together. *He learned how to design algorythms where a robotic walking dog can navigate through a terrain*. He compared this with construction environment where there are a lot uncertainty around you. Machines paired with Human takes the power from both sides. 

There were a few criteria the company looked at to come up with the design solution or what issue they are trying to address. 

* Dirty: This is always a messy work
* Danger: Most drywall finisher end up at their retirement with orthopedic issues on the shoulders and arms, or even falling during work
* Lack of innovation: How long there hasn't been any innovation
* Repetition: It has been the same drywall, it is everywhere, and being finished the same way for decades.
